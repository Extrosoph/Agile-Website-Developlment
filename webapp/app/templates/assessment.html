                        <p>Due to the orbit of the moon, from a specific location on Earth, 
                        the moon seems to change shape as it orbits. This is due to the sunlight hitting the 
                        Moon at different angles and due to the Earth’s shadow, causing different parts of the 
                        moon to be illuminated as it orbits the Earth. The different shapes are knoown

                        <p>The gravitational attraction of the Earth on the Moon keeps it in orbit, 
                                but the Moon also has its own gravitational pull on the Earth. 
                                The Moon has a mass approximately 1.2% that of Earth’s, this means there is a 
                                significant gravitational pull from the Moon on the Earth. </p>
                        <br>

                                low-tide as seen on a beach or foreshore, and is essential for the 
                                lifecycles of many aquatic creatures.</p>

                                and so causes the centre-of-mass of the Earth-Moon system to lie 4,671 km 
                                away from the centre of the earth, 1700km below the surface of the Earth. 
                                This means the Earth actually rotates around the combined centre-of-mass

                <p>The Moon allows two extraordinary events to occur throughout the year, 
                        namely the solar and lunar eclipses. Both occur when the Sun, Moon and Earth

                        <p style='padding-left: 2em;'>A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon lies directly in 
                                between the earth and the sun, blocking out the sun completely. This can only 
                                occur, co-incidentally, because the angular size of the sun and the moon in 
                                the sky are the same (0.5°). This allows astronomers to see the outer edges of 
                                the sun, which is called the Corona, something that is otherwise invisible.</p>

                                the Earth comes between the Moon and the Sun. The Sun’s light cannot reach 
                                the Moon directly, but instead passes around the Earth, through the Earth’s 
                                atmosphere. The Atmosphere absorbs most of the light and leaves only the 
                                longest wavelength red light to illuminate the Moon. This phenomenon is what 
                                causes a ‘Blood Moon’ where the moon appears to be a reddish-orange hue.</p>

                        would not exist, hence the name ‘solar’ – meaning sun, and ‘system’, meaning sun’s

        <br>
        <div style='padding-left:2em;padding-right:4em;'>
                <p>The Sun has an extremely strong gravitational field, which arises due to its large mass. 
                        In fact the sun weighs about 1.989 x 1030 kg. In addition to being large and having 
                        lots of mass, the Sun is extremely bright and hot. This is because the Sun burns 
                        Hydrogen in its core through fusion, which can only occur at extremely high 
                        temperatures. The core temperature of the sun is ≈ 15 million °C. </p>
                        <br> 
                        <p>However the temperature rapidly decreases 
                        towards the surface where the temperature is about 5,505 °C. The Sun is also very 
                        far from the Earth, about 151 million km, it is due to this that the Earth does not 
                        get bombarded with radiation from the sun and life can flourish here on Earth. This 
                        is known as the ‘Goldilock’s Zone’ where just the right amount of radiation reaches 
                        Earth to sustain life.</p>
